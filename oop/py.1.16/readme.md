# Working with archives

## [main.py](main.py)

Contains the `add_to_zip()` function. It adds files with certain extensions to archive with given name.

## [test_main.py](test_main.py)

Tests with [logging](logs.log). My tests are poor so far. But I started to understand a little how to use them. Still i need to dig into testing more.
