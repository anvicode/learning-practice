# Dictionary/map

I made extended comments this time. Almost to every line. And i liked it. For better understanding what's going on in my code it is suits well.

## [main.py](main.py)

Contains `create_dict_with_random_pairs()` function that creates dictionary with 100 random pairs.
I found `string` module. With `string.ascii_lowercase` and `string.ascii_uppercase` i made `value:str` a funky way. At least i think so. I liked it. With `random.choices()` and a `k=5` of course.

## [main_the_second.py](main_the_second.py)

Contains `find_repeated_values()` function that finds repeated values in dictionary at least n times.

## Tests and Logging

Here: [test_main.py](test_main.py) and [test_main_the_second.py](test_main_the_second.py)

Logging: [logs.log](logs.log)
