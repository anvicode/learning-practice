# Working with files and directories

## [ls.py](ls.py)

Contains the `get_files_subdirs_list()` function. It generates a list of files and subdirectories in a given path that match a specified file extension.

## [del_dir.py](del_dir.py)

Contains the `delete_directory()` function. It deletes a directory and all its contents if directory exists and has no subdirectories.

## [test_ls.py](test_ls.py) and [test_del_dir.py](test_del_dir.py)

I'm still getting used to writing unittests and use logging. ~~I don't even know if this is the right way to do it.~~ I need to dig into it deeper.
